# PHP - Email-Form

A simple example of an email form. Perhaps you've seen this on some personal websites where the owner provides a method to quickly get in touch with them.

The contactform.php file houses the php code used to send an email.
<br />
<p><b>WARNING: Be sure to change the value of the $to variable on line 10 in  the contactform.php file. That is the address that the email will be sent to.</b></p>

These two files must be used in a hosted environment that supports PHP.
